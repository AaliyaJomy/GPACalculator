            <h2 id="section1">Weighted GPA vs. Unweighted GPA: What’s the Difference?</h2>
            <p>An unweighted GPA averages grades on a 4.0 scale regardless of course difficulty, while a weighted GPA adjusts for harder classes, potentially giving grades higher than 4.0. The exact value depends on your school's grading system, but the idea is to reward students for taking on tougher academic challenges.<br>

                To calculate a weighted GPA, each grade is multiplied by a corresponding weight (usually on a scale higher than 4.0 for honors or AP classes) before averaging them together. This can result in a GPA above 4.0 for students who excel in challenging coursework.<br>
                
                In simple terms, unweighted GPAs treat all grades the same, while weighted GPAs adjust for the difficulty of your classes by giving more credit for tougher courses. Different schools use different systems to evaluate students' academic performance.</p>

            <h2 id="section2">How to Calculate Weighted & Unweighted GPAs</h2>
            <p> Calculating an unweighted GPA involves straightforward arithmetic. First, assign each letter grade a numerical value, typically on a scale from 0 to 4, with A being 4, B being 3, C being 2, D being 1, and F being 0. 
                <br><br>
                Next, add up all the numerical values of your grades. Then, divide the sum by the total number of classes you've taken. This yields your unweighted GPA.
                <br><br>
                For example, if you've earned two A's (4 + 4 = 8) and one B (3), your sum would be 11. Divide 11 by the total number of classes, let's say 3, and your unweighted GPA would be approximately 3.67.
                <br><br>
                Calculating an weighted GPA involves straightforward arithmetic. First, assign each letter grade a numerical value, typically on a scale from 0 to 5, with A being 4.5, B being 3.5, C being 2.5, D being 1.5, and F being 0. 
                <br><br>
                Next, add up all the numerical values of your grades. Then, divide the sum by the total number of classes you've taken. This yields your weighted GPA.
                <br><br>
                For example, if you've earned two A's (4.5 + 4.5 = 9) and one B (3.5), your sum would be 12.5. Divide 12.5 by the total number of classes, let's say 3, and your weighted GPA would be approximately 4.17.

            <h2 id="section3">Weighted & Unweighted GPA Calculator</h2>
            <p>To make calculating your weighted and unweighted GPAs easier, consider using an online GPA calculator. These tools allow you to input your grades for each course and then automatically compute your GPA based on the corresponding grade point scale. 

                Whether you have letter grades or percentage scores, these calculators provide a simple way to get an accurate assessment of your GPA.
                
                While we don't specifically endorse any particular calculator, there are many reliable options available online. Simply search for ‘weighted GPA calculator’ or ‘unweighted GPA calculator" to find one that suits your needs. 
                
                These resources can be helpful for students, parents, and educators, offering an easy way to evaluate academic performance and set goals for the future.</p>

            <h2 id="section4">Do Colleges Look at Weighted or Unweighted GPAs?</h2>
            <p>Medical school admissions committees consider more than just GPAs; they also weigh the difficulty of coursework, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and other components of your application.<br>

                For example, a student with a perfect 4.0 GPA might not impress as much as someone with a slightly lower GPA of 3.7 who tackled more challenging classes while staying active in extracurriculars. While some medical schools have minimum GPA requirements, meeting them doesn't guarantee admission. These requirements help manage the large number of applicants.
                
                And if you're aiming for scholarships, you'll likely need a GPA higher than the minimum admission requirement. So, while a 2.0 GPA might be enough to get in, scholarships often require at least a 3.0 GPA.
                
                To level the playing field between weighted and unweighted GPAs, many medical schools recalculate them, focusing on key subjects like biology, chemistry, and math while ignoring non-academic courses.</p>
